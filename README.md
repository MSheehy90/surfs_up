# Surfs Up
## Overview
We are looking at weather trends for the island of Oahu to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable year-round. In this analysis, we will compare the temperatures for month of June and December.
## Results

- When comparing the averages, there is a difference of 3.9 degrees fahrenheit or 5.2% drop from June to December. 
- From June to December the max temperature has 2 degree fahrenheit difference, with June being 85 degrees and December 83 degrees. When comparing the min temperature, we see a much more significant drop of 8 degrees with June being 64 degrees and December being 56 degrees.
- While the min temperature drop is significant, we can look at the percentile spread to determine the min temp of 56 degrees is below the 25th percentile so although possible, it's not common.

## Summary

Avy can perform is looking at rainy days between June and December. Secondly, W. Avy can query days from the most recent year and perform a line plot overlaying both months to compare which days of the month may be less active.
